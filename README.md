## Akai MPC MKII Repo of stuff
This is a repo of stuff I've made for the Akai MPC MKII. I've been using the MPC for a while now and I've made a few things that I think are worth sharing. I'll be adding more as I make them.

### Contents
Now  there is only the main part, which was sending images to the display for now. I'll try and make a midi mapping for FL Studio soon.

### How to use
Run NPM install. Then run `node index.js` and follow the instructions. You'll need to have the MPC connected to your computer via USB and it has to be put in MIDI mode.
